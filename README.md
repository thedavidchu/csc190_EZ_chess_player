# csc190_EZ_chess_player
## Course
CSC190: Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Description
Plays EZ-Chess (i.e. no castling, en pasant, double jump for the pawn, automatic pawn promotion to queen). The two working files are Automatic_Game.py and TwoPlayer_Game.py

## Limitations
The rules of the game are simplified such that there is no castling, en pasant, double jumps for the pawn, and pawns are automatically promoted to queens if they reach the other side. This simplifies the min-max tree that the program must search and it is also as per the project requirements.
